# tf-embed

This workspace contains a Jupyter notebook `test.ipynb` that demonstrates computing sentence embeddings
using Sentence-Transformers, visualizing with UMAP, and exporting artifacts for the TensorBoard Projector.

Quick start

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (3.8+ recommended).
2. Install dependencies: sentence-transformers, umap-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, japanize-matplotlib
3. Open and run `test.ipynb` from top to bottom.

Notes
- The notebook contains helper functions at the top for model loading, encoding, dimensionality reduction,
  plotting, and saving Projector-compatible files.
