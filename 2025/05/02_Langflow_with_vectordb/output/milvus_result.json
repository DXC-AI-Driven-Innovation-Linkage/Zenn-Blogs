    "text":"IBM Vela and Blue Vela AI Infrastructure\n2.4 Workload performance on Vela\nOver the last two years, AI researchers and practitioners from across IBM have trained\nadvanced AI models and prototyped AI technologies on Vela, including IBM\u2019s next-\ngeneration AI studio, watsonx.ai, which became generally available in July of 2023 [10].\nWatsonx.ai is now deployed in many of IBM Cloud\u2019s global locations, a testament to the\nflexibility and global deployability of Vela\u2019s design. This section will provide examples\nof the outstanding performance we achieve on Vela without compromising on the flexible\ndesign requirement.\nIn our training runs, tensor parallelism (TP), pipeline parallelism (PP) and data paral-\nlelism (DP) [21, 12, 8] are used to support the training of larger models on multiple GPUs\nto minimize the training time. For example, the Granite 20B Code model was trained on\n768 GPUs with 4-way TP , 4-way PP , and 48-way DP . The point-to-point communication for"
